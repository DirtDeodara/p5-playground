## My exploration into P5.js
This has been such a wonderful journey into the lands of P5 and generative art. I've historically built these shapes with pen and paper, and I'm really excited to be able to prototype them now with this amazing tool.

This is an ongoing project that I hope to deploy in the next few months.
